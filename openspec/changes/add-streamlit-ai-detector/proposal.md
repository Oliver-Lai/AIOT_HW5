# Proposal: AI vs Human Text Detector Web Application

## Change ID
`add-streamlit-ai-detector`

## Why
The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an urgent need for accessible tools to verify text authenticity. This application addresses the growing demand from educators, content moderators, and writers for a simple, reliable way to detect ChatGPT-generated text.

## What Changes
- Create new Streamlit web application (`app.py`)
- Integrate pre-trained "Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta" model
- Implement text input interface with validation
- Add visual result display with progress bars and color-coded status messages
- Create Python dependencies file (`requirements.txt`)
- Optimize for Streamlit Cloud deployment with resource caching

## Impact
- **New Capabilities**: streamlit-web-app, ai-text-detection, results-display, python-dependencies
- **Affected Code**: None (new project)
- **Breaking Changes**: None (new application)

## Summary
Create a Streamlit-based web application that detects whether text content was generated by AI (specifically ChatGPT) or written by a human. The application will use a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model to classify text input and display results with visual feedback and probability metrics.

## Motivation
Provide a user-friendly web interface for detecting AI-generated content, enabling educators, content moderators, and general users to verify text authenticity. The application addresses the growing need to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content in various contexts.

## Objectives
1. Deploy a functional Streamlit web application with an intuitive UI
2. Integrate the "Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta" model for classification
3. Display clear, visual results with percentage probabilities
4. Optimize for Streamlit Cloud deployment with efficient resource usage
5. Provide responsive user feedback and proper error handling

## Scope

### In Scope
- Streamlit web application (`app.py`)
- Text input interface with validation
- Model integration using Hugging Face transformers
- Visual result display with progress bars and color-coded feedback
- Memory-optimized model loading with caching
- Python dependencies specification (`requirements.txt`)
- Basic error handling for empty input

### Out of Scope
- Multi-language support
- Batch text processing
- Custom model training or fine-tuning
- User authentication or data persistence
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Detailed text analysis (highlighting specific sections)
- Historical result tracking

## Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Educators, content moderators, writers, researchers
- **Deployment Platform**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Model Provider**: Hello-SimpleAI via Hugging Face

## Success Criteria
1. Application successfully loads on Streamlit Cloud without memory issues
2. Model predictions return within 5 seconds for typical text inputs (100-1000 words)
3. UI clearly displays AI vs Human probability with visual indicators
4. Application handles edge cases (empty input, very long text) gracefully
5. Zero deployment-blocking errors in production environment

## Constraints
- Memory limitations on Streamlit Cloud free tier
- Model must be loaded once and cached to prevent re-initialization
- Must use publicly available pre-trained model (no API keys required)
- Single-page application design (no multi-page navigation)

## Risks
1. **Model size/memory**: The RoBERTa model may be large; mitigation via `@st.cache_resource`
2. **Inference latency**: First prediction may be slow; user feedback with loading indicator required
3. **Model accuracy**: Pre-trained model limitations on certain text types; display probabilities transparently
4. **Rate limiting**: Hugging Face model downloads; no mitigation needed for stable deployment

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- streamlit (latest stable)
- transformers (Hugging Face)
- torch or tensorflow (model backend)
- Internet connection for initial model download

## Timeline
- **Proposal Review**: 1 day
- **Implementation**: 1-2 days
- **Testing**: 1 day
- **Deployment**: 1 day

## Related Changes
None (initial application creation)

## Open Questions
1. Should we add a character/word limit for input text? (Recommendation: 5000 words max)
2. Do we need to handle multiple languages, or English-only? (Assumption: English-only for v1)
3. Should we display model confidence thresholds (e.g., "High Confidence" vs "Low Confidence")? (Recommendation: Yes, add confidence indicators)

## Notes
- The model "Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta" is specifically trained for ChatGPT detection
- UI will use Streamlit's native components for rapid development
- Application follows Streamlit best practices for cloud deployment
